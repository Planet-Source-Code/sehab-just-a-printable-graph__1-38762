## Just A Printable Graph


</div>

### Description

Sorry I couldn't upload the screenshot. My graph has some features that are good. You can name your graph. You can make your own graph by entering the numbers. There are two modes--Bar Graph and Line Graph. You can Preview and Print your graph. It's not hard to understand.
